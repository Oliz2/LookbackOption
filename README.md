This project implements Monte Carlo simulations for pricing both floating- and fixed-strike lookback options, with support for continuous and discrete monitoring. Analytical formulas are used for continuously monitored options under Black-Scholes, while approximation methods handle discretely monitored cases. The implementation is structured with dedicated classes for each option type and includes test cases to validate accuracy and convergence. Additional analyses explore the effect of monitoring frequency and Monte Carlo pricing under alternative models. The project is ongoing and code, tests, and reports are being completed.
